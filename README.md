# erwin &mdash; a qMRI toolbox

*erwin* is a Python-based toolbox dedicated to the computation of parametric maps from MRI data. Accessible through either its Python API or its command-line interface, *erwin* provides a unified interface to well-known methods and toolboxes.

- Field mapping: relative B<sub>0</sub> and relative B<sub>1</sub> 
- Cerebral blood flow: <abbr title="Arterial Spin Labelling">ASL</abbr>-based models (pulsed ASL, pseudo-continuous ASL)
- Diffusion: DTI and spherical harmonics (MRtrix), NODDI (Amico)
- Motion correction: based on ANTs
- Magnetization transfer: MTR and single-point qMT
- Susceptibility: QSM and R<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup> based on the MEDI toolbox
- T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> mapping: VFA, bSSFP, pSSFP
